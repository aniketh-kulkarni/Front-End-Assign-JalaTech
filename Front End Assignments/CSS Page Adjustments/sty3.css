3. To create links that allow you to scroll smoothly to the top and bottom of a long page, you can use the following HTML code

<a href="#top" style="scroll-behavior: smooth;">Click to go to top of page</a>
<a href="#bottom" style="scroll-behavior: smooth;">Click to go to bottom of page</a>

<!-- The page content goes here -->

<a name="top"></a>

<!-- The page content goes here -->

<a name="bottom"></a>

#This will add two links that will allow you to scroll smoothly to the top and bottom of the page when clicked.
